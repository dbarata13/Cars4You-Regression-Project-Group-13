Project Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on vehicle characteristics. Accurate price estimation supports fair and competitive pricing in the automotive resale market.
A full data science pipeline was implemented, including data preprocessing, feature encoding, scaling, feature selection, and model evaluation.

Methodology:

Holdout split for training and validation

Missing value imputation and outlier treatment

Target encoding for categorical variables

Standard scaling for numerical features

Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection

Results

Six models were evaluated. The HistGradientBoosting model achieved the best performance with a validation MAE of ~£1,300.

Tools

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SHAP
